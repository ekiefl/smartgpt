Of the following, the most strongly reflected wavelength is	500 nm	550 nm	600 nm	650 nm	C	"Please choose the most correct answer for the following multiple choice question about college physics. White light is normally incident on a puddle of water (index of refraction 1.33). A thin (500 nm) layer of oil (index of refraction 1.5) floats on the surface of the puddle. Of the following, the most strongly reflected wavelength is

A. 500 nm
B. 550 nm
C. 600 nm
D. 650 nm
"	False	False	False	B. 550 nm	"Step 1: Since the reflection occurs at the oil-water interface, we must first find the wavelength of light in the oil. To do this, we use the formula:

wavelength_in_oil = wavelength_in_air / index_of_refraction_of_oil

Step 2: Next, we need the condition for strong reflection, which comes from the principle of constructive interference. For this to occur, the optical path difference between two rays undergoing reflection, one at the oil-air interface, and the other at the oil-water interface should be an integral multiple of the wavelength. In this case, twice the layer thickness is equal to an integral multiple of the wavelength_in_oil.

2 * layer_thickness = n * wavelength_in_oil

Step 3: Solving this for the wavelength in air:

wavelength_in_air = 2 * layer_thickness * index_of_refraction_of_oil / n

Step 4: Plugging in the given values for layer thickness (500 nm) and index of refraction of oil (1.5), we get:

wavelength_in_air = 2 * (500 nm) * 1.5 / n

Step 5: Now, we must find the lowest value of 'n' that would result in a wavelength within the visible spectrum (approximately 400-700 nm). For n = 1, we get:

wavelength_in_air = 2 * (500 nm) * 1.5 / 1 = 1500 nm

This is outside the visible spectrum. Let's try n = 2:

wavelength_in_air = 2 * (500 nm) * 1.5 / 2 = 750 nm

This is still outside the visible spectrum. Let's try n = 3:

wavelength_in_air = 2 * (500 nm) * 1.5 / 3 = 500 nm

This is within the visible spectrum and corresponds to option A, 500 nm.

Therefore, the most strongly reflected wavelength is 500 nm. 

Answer: A. 500 nm"	"Step 1: Determine the condition for constructive interference in the reflected light.

For constructive interference to occur, the path difference between rays reflecting off the top and bottom surfaces of the oil layer should be an integral multiple of the wavelength. The path difference (in terms of thickness) when light travels through the oil is 2t, where t is the thickness of the oil layer (500 nm). 

Step 2: Calculate the effective path difference in terms of the wavelength in air.

Since the index of refraction of oil is 1.5, the effective path difference in air is 2t * (1.5 / 1) = 3t = 3 * 500 nm = 1500 nm.

Step 3: Find the wavelength for which this path difference is an integral multiple.

We are looking for the smallest integral value of n such that 1500 nm = n * λ. We can see that for n = 2, the wavelength λ = 750 nm. Unfortunately, this wavelength is outside the visible range (which is between 400 nm and 700 nm). 

Step 4: Check for the next possible constructive interference wavelength.

Now let's try n = 3: λ = 1500 nm / 3 = 500 nm, which is within the visible range. Therefore, the most strongly reflected wavelength is 500 nm.

Answer: A. 500 nm"	False

C. The entropy of the system and its environment remains unchanged.
D. The entropy of the system and its environment must increase.
"	True	True	True	C. The entropy of the system and its environment remains unchanged.	"A reversible thermodynamic process is an idealization in which a system undergoes a change in such a way that, at the end of the process, both the system and its environment can be restored to their original states without any net change to either.

A. This statement is not necessarily true for a reversible process. The internal energy of the system can change during a reversible process, as long as the process can be reversed.

B. The temperature of the system does not have to remain constant during a reversible process. A reversible process can involve a change in temperature, as long as it is possible to reverse the process and return the system to its original state.

C. The entropy of the system and its environment remains unchanged during a reversible process. Since the process can be reversed and return the system and its environment to their original states, there is no net increase or decrease in entropy

D. The entropy of the system and its environment must increase. This statement is false for a reversible process. Since the process is reversible the net change in entropy is zero, not increasing.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. The entropy for the system and its environment remains unchanged during a reversible thermodynamic process."	"In a reversible thermodynamic process, the system and its surroundings can be returned to their initial states without leaving any lasting effect. Internal energy can change during the process, as work can be done on or by the system. The temperature of the system does not necessarily remain constant; it depends on the type of reversible process, such as isothermal or adiabatic expansion. The entropy of the system and its environment remains unchanged in a reversible process, as any infinitesimal changes in entropy cancel each other out, maintaining the total entropy. In contrast, the entropy of the system and its environment increases in an irreversible process.

Therefore, the correct answer is: C. The entropy of the system and its environment remains unchanged during a reversible thermodynamic process."	False

"	True	True	True	B. The Pauli exclusion principle	"A. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle deals with the uncertainty in the position and momentum of a particle. This principle doesn't directly relate to the energy difference between ortho- and para-states in a helium atom, so we can eliminate this option.

B. The Pauli exclusion principle states that no two fermions (like electrons) in a quantum system can have the same set of quantum numbers. This principle does affect the arrangement of electron spins in different energy states, so it is a possible answer.

C. The Bohr model of the atom describes electrons moving in circular orbits around the nucleus. While it introduced some key concepts in atomic physics, it doesn't adequately explain the difference in energy between ortho- and para-states. Thus, we can eliminate this option.

D. Nuclear hyperfine coupling refers to the interaction between the magnetic moments of the nucleus and the electrons. However, this interaction is generally much weaker than the other forces at play, and it doesn't directly explain the energy difference between ortho- and para-states in a helium atom. So we can eliminate this option as well.

B. The Pauli exclusion principle states that no two electrons in an atom can have the same set of quantum numbers, specifically including their spins. This principle helps explain the energy difference between the para- and ortho-states, because the different electron spins lead to different spatial distributions of the wavefunctions, which in turn affects the electron-electron repulsion and the overall energy of the system. So, this is the correct answer.

C. The Bohr model of the atom is an older model that only considers electron orbits in a hydrogen atom and does not properly account for electron spins and many-electron systems like helium. So, this is not the correct answer.

D. Nuclear hyperfine coupling deals with the interaction between the magnetic fields of the nucleus and the electrons, affecting the energy levels of electron orbits. However, this interaction is typically much weaker than the effects of the electron spins and the other forces at play in determining the energy difference between para- and ortho-states.

Which of the following gives the total spin quantum number of the electrons in the ground state of neutral nitrogen (Z = 7)?

A. 1/2
B. 1
C. 3/2
D. 5/2
"	True	False	True	C. 3/2	"First, let's determine the electron configuration of neutral nitrogen. Nitrogen has 7 electrons, so the electron configuration is 1s², 2s², 2p³.

To find out the total spin quantum number, we must consider only the partially filled subshell, which is the 2p subshell (with 3 electrons). For a p subshell, there are three possible orbitals, with 2 electrons occupying each orbital (one spin up and one spin down).

The three electrons will occupy all three orbitals in the 2p subshell, so one of the orbitals will have an electron with spin up (+1/2) and the other two orbitals will have electrons with spin down (-1/2).

The total spin quantum number S will be determined by adding up the spins of the electrons in the partially filled subshell:

S = (1/2) + (-1/2) + (-1/2) = -1/2

However, the total spin quantum number must be a positive value, so we take the absolute value:

S = | -1/2 | = 1/2

Therefore, the correct answer is A. 1/2."	"Step 1: Write the electron configuration for neutral nitrogen.
Nitrogen has 7 electrons, so its electron configuration is 1s² 2s² 2p³.

Step 2: Determine the spin quantum number for the electrons in the 2p orbital.
There are three electrons in the 2p orbital. According to Hund's rule, these electrons will fill the available orbitals with parallel spins before pairing up. So, all three electrons will have a spin of +1/2.

Step 3: Calculate the total spin quantum number (S) for the electrons in the 2p orbital.
Total spin (S) = 1/2 (from first 2p electron) + 1/2 (from second 2p electron) + 1/2 (from third 2p electron) = 3/2

So, the most correct answer for the total spin quantum number of the electrons in the ground state of neutral nitrogen is:

V_0/5	V_0/3	V_0/2	2V_0/3	D	"Please choose the most correct answer for the following multiple choice question about college physics. Consider three identical, ideal capacitors. The first capacitor is charged to a voltage and then disconnected from the battery. The other two capacitors, initially uncharged and connected in series, are then connected across the first capacitor. What is the final voltage on the first capacitor?

A. V_0/5
B. V_0/3
C. V_0/2
D. 2V_0/3
"	False	False	True	B. V_0/3	"Step 1: Find the equivalent capacitance when the two uncharged capacitors are connected in series.
For capacitors in series, the equivalent capacitance C_eq is given by:
1/C_eq = 1/C1 + 1/C2
Since the capacitors are identical, C1 = C2 = C. Therefore,
1/C_eq = 1/C + 1/C = 2/C
C_eq = C/2

Step 2: When the charged capacitor (C1) is connected across the two uncharged capacitors (C2 and C3), the total charge on the system is conserved.

Let Q1 be the initial charge on the charged capacitor, and V_0 be the initial voltage across it. Therefore, Q1 = C*V_0. Also, let Q2 and Q3 be the charges on the uncharged capacitors after connection.

After the connection, all capacitors will have the same voltage across them, which we will call V_final. The charge conservation principle implies:

Q1 = Q2 + Q3

Step 3: Find the final voltage on the capacitors.

Since V_final is the same across all the capacitors,
Q2 = C2 * V_final = C * V_final
Q3 = C3 * V_final = C * V_final

Substituting Q2 and Q3 in the expression for the charge conservation equation, we get:
Q1 = Q2 + Q3 = C * V_final + C * V_final = 2 * C * V_final

Now plugging the initial charge Q1 and the initial voltage V_0,
C * V_0 = 2 * C * V_final

Dividing by 2 * C, we find the final voltage on the first capacitor:
V_final = V_0 / 2

So, the correct answer is C. V_0/2."	"Step 1: Calculate the total capacitance of the two capacitors initially connected in series.
For capacitors in series, the total capacitance C_total is given by the formula:
1/C_total = 1/C_2 + 1/C_3

Since all capacitors have the same capacitance C, the equation becomes:
1/C_total = 1/C + 1/C = 2/C

So, C_total = C/2

Step 2: When the three capacitors are connected, the charge on the first capacitor is redistributed among all three capacitors. They are connected in parallel, sharing the same terminals. Thus, total charge is conserved. The charge Q_initial on the first capacitor is given by:
Q_initial = C * V_0

The total charge Q_final is given by:
Q_final = C_total * V_final + C_2 * V_final

Since C_total = C/2 and C_2 = C_3 = C, the equation becomes:
Q_final = C * V_0 = (C/2) * V_final + C * V_final

Step 3: Solve for the final voltage V_final:
V_final = (C * V_0) / (3C/2)
V_final = (2 * V_0) / 3

Therefore, the final voltage on the first capacitor is 2V_0/3."	False

"	False	True	True	"To solve this problem, we can use the centripetal force and friction force equations:

Fc = μ * m * g, where Fc is the centripetal force, μ is the coefficient of static friction, m is the mass of the coin (which cancels out), and g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s^2).

Fc = m * a, where a is the centripetal acceleration.

Since Fc = μ * m * g and Fc = m * a, we can write:

μ * m * g = m * a

μ * g = a

We can calculate the centripetal acceleration using the following formula:

a = r * ω², where r is the distance from the center of the turntable and ω is the angular velocity in rad/s.

First, we need to convert the rotations per minute to rad/s:

ω = 33.3 rev/min * 2π rad/rev * 1 min/60 s = π rad/s.

Step 2: Set up the equation for the static friction force.
Friction force = Static friction coefficient * Normal force
F_friction = μ * m * g

Step 3: Set up the equation for the centripetal force to keep the coin from sliding along a circular path.
Centripetal force = m * r * ω^2 (where m is the mass of the coin, r is the distance from the center of the turntable, and ω is the angular velocity)

Step 4: The maximum static friction force is equal to the centripetal force at the point when the coin starts to slide.
μ * m * g = m * r * ω^2

Step 5: Cancel out the mass of the coin (m) since it's present on both sides of the equation.
μ * g = r * ω^2

In this process, four hydrogen nuclei (protons) combine to form one helium nucleus, which consists of two protons and two neutrons. There is a mass difference between the four hydrogen nuclei and the one helium nucleus, and this mass difference is converted into energy according to the equation E = mc^2, where E is energy, m is mass, and c is the speed of light.

So, the correct answer is:

B. four hydrogen atoms and one helium atom"	"The primary source of the Sun's energy is nuclear fusion, specifically the fusion of hydrogen atoms to form helium atoms through a process called the proton-proton chain. In this process:

1. Two hydrogen nuclei (protons) collide to form deuterium, a positron, and a neutrino.
2. Deuterium collides with another hydrogen nucleus to form helium-3 and a photon.
3. Two helium-3 nuclei collide to produce a helium-4 nucleus and two hydrogen nuclei.

In the last step, we combine four hydrogen nuclei (protons) in total to produce one helium nucleus. The mass difference between the four hydrogen atoms and one helium atom is the mass that is converted into energy according to Einstein's famous equation, E = mc^2. Therefore, the most correct answer is:

"	True	True	False	A. Lines in the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet regions of the spectrum reveal primarily the nuclear structure of the sample.	"A. Lines in the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet regions of the spectrum reveal primarily the nuclear structure of the sample.

This statement is incorrect because these lines actually reveal information about the electronic structure of the sample, not the nuclear structure. The nucleus consists of protons and neutrons, whereas the electronic structure relates to the arrangement and energy levels of the electrons orbiting the nucleus.

B. The wavelengths identified in an absorption spectrum of an element are among those in its emission spectrum.

This statement is correct. An absorption spectrum shows the wavelengths of light absorbed by a sample, and an emission spectrum shows the wavelengths emitted by the sample. The absorbed and emitted wavelengths are related because they correspond to the electron energy level transitions within the atoms of the sample.

C. Absorption spectra can be used to determine which elements are present in distant stars.

This statement is correct. By analyzing the absorption spectrum of a distant star, scientists can determine which elements are present in its atmosphere. Different elements will absorb specific wavelengths of light, creating a unique pattern in the spectrum. By comparing these patterns to known spectra of elements, the composition of the star can be determined.

D. Spectral analysis can be used to identify the composition of galactic dust.

This statement is correct. By analyzing the spectra of light from distant objects that have passed through galactic dust, scientists can determine the composition of the dust. The dust will cause certain wavelengths of light to be absorbed or scattered, creating a characteristic pattern in the spectra. These patterns can be compared to known spectra of different materials to identify the composition of the dust.

Answer: The statement that is NOT correct is A. Lines in the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet regions of the spectrum reveal primarily the nuclear structure of the sample."	"A. Lines in the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet regions of the spectrum reveal primarily the nuclear structure of the sample.

This statement is NOT correct. These lines reveal information about the electronic structure of the sample, not the nuclear structure. The electronic structure refers to the arrangement and behavior of electrons in atoms and molecules, whereas the nuclear structure refers to the arrangement and behavior of protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus.

B. The wavelengths identified in an absorption spectrum of an element are among those in its emission spectrum.

This statement is correct. When an element absorbs light, its electrons move to higher energy levels. When the electrons return to lower energy levels, they emit light at the same wavelengths as they absorbed it. Thus, the wavelengths observed in an element's absorption spectrum match those in its emission spectrum.

C. Absorption spectra can be used to determine which elements are present in distant stars.

This statement is correct. When the light from a star passes through a cool gas, the gas absorbs certain wavelengths of light, which correspond to specific elements in the gas. By analyzing the wavelengths of light absorbed by the gas, astronomers can determine which elements are present in the star's atmosphere.

D. Spectral analysis can be used to identify the composition of galactic dust.

This statement is correct. Spectral analysis of light emitted or absorbed by galactic dust can provide information about the elements present in the dust and their relative abundances. This can help astronomers understand the composition and history of the interstellar medium and the process of star and planet formation.

"	False	True	True	A. an average of 10 times, with an rms deviation of about 4	"The quantum efficiency of a photon detector is the ratio of the number of photons detected to the number of photons incident on the detector. In this case, the quantum efficiency is 0.1, which means that on average, 10% of the photons sent into the detector will be detected.

1. First, let's find the average number of detections: 100 photons * 0.1 = 10 detections on average.

2. The number of detections is a binomial process with n = 100 and p = 0.1. The variance of a binomial distribution is given by: σ² = n * p * (1-p)

3. Plugging in the numbers: σ² = 100 * 0.1 * (1-0.1) = 100 * 0.1 * 0.9 = 9.

4. Now, we need to find the rms deviation, which is the square root of the variance: σ = sqrt(9) = 3.

The correct answer is B. an average of 10 times, with an rms deviation of about 3."	"Step 1: Calculate the average number of detections.
The quantum efficiency is given as 0.1, which means that on average, the detector will detect 10% of the photons that are sent into it. So, if we have 100 photons sent in, we can expect it to detect 10% * 100 = 10 photons on average.

Step 2: Calculate the binomial variance.
The formula for the variance in binomial distribution is variance = N * p * (1-p), where N is the number of trials (in this case, the number of photons sent in) and p is the probability of success (in this case, the quantum efficiency). So, we have variance = 100 * 0.1 * (1 - 0.1) = 100 * 0.1 * 0.9 = 9.

Step 3: Calculate the root mean square deviation.
The root mean square deviation is just the square root of the variance. So, we have rms deviation = sqrt(9) = 3.

Putting it all together, the detector will detect photons an average of 10 times, with an rms deviation of about 3. So, the correct answer is B. an average of 10 times, with an rms deviation of about 3."	False

A. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle relates the uncertainties in the position and momentum of a particle. It doesn't directly explain the energy difference between ortho- and para-states.

B. The Pauli exclusion principle states that no two fermions (such as electrons) can occupy the same quantum state. Since para- and ortho-states have different electron spins, they are distinct quantum states. The exclusion principle doesn't directly explain why the ortho-state has lower energy.

C. The Bohr model of the atom is a simplified model where electrons orbit the nucleus in circular orbits with specific energy levels. This model doesn't take electron spins into account, so it can't explain the energy difference between ortho- and para-states.

D. Nuclear hyperfine coupling refers to the interaction between the nuclear spin and the electron spin in an atom. Two electrons with parallel spins (ortho-state) will have a stronger exchange interaction, leading to lower total energy compared to electrons with antiparallel spins (para-state).

Based on our analysis, the correct answer is:

D. Nuclear hyperfine coupling"	"The Heisenberg uncertainty principle (A) refers to the limits in determining the position and momentum of a particle simultaneously, so it doesn't directly explain the difference in energy states between ortho- and para-helium.

The Pauli exclusion principle (B) states that no two fermions (such as electrons) can be in the same quantum state simultaneously. This principle helps explain the electron spin pairing in ortho- and para-states. In the case of ortho-helium, the reduced electron-electron repulsion due to occupying different spatial orbitals results in lower energy compared to the para-state.

The Bohr model of the atom (C) provides a structure for the hydrogen atom, but does not explain the differences in the energy states between ortho and para helium, especially since it is not entirely accurate for multi-electron atoms like helium.

Nuclear hyperfine coupling (D) involves energy level changes due to the interactions between electron and nuclear spins, but this is not the primary reason for the observed differences in energy between ortho- and para-helium states.

In the absence of friction, what is the total mechanical energy of the system?

A. 0.24 mJ
B. 0.38 mJ
C. 0.48 mJ
D. 0.75 mJ
"	False	False	True	D. 0.75 mJ	"Step 1: Calculate the spring constant (k)
We know that the mass (m) is 0.30 kg and it was displaced (x) by 0.030 m from its equilibrium position.
Using Hooke's Law, we can write:
F = kx

The spring force (F) can also be defined as:
F = ma

Equating the two definitions of force, we get:
kx = ma

As the mass passes through the equilibrium position, the force on the mass is zero, and the acceleration (a) is the maximum. The maximum acceleration (a_max) can be calculated using the formula:
a_max = (v^2)/(2x)

where v is the speed when the mass is at its equilibrium position (0.040 m/s in this case).

Therefore, a_max = (0.040^2)/(2*0.030) = 0.0267 m/s^2

Now, we can find the spring constant (k) using:
k = (ma)/x = (0.30*0.0267)/0.030 = 0.267 N/m

Step 2: Calculate the total mechanical energy of the system

The total mechanical energy of the system can be obtained by summing the kinetic energy (KE) and potential energy (PE) at any point. In this case, we will take the kinetic and potential energies when the mass is at its maximum displacement (0.030 m) and at rest (v = 0), so KE = 0.

PE is stored in the spring due to the displacement and is given by:
PE = (1/2)kx^2

Substituting the values of k and x, we get:
PE = (1/2)(0.267)(0.030)^2 = 0.00120 J

Since at this instant, KE = 0, the total mechanical energy of the system is equal to the potential energy of the spring:
E_total = PE = 0.00120 J = 1.20 mJ

None of the given options match the correct answer of 1.20 mJ."	"Step 1: Find the potential energy when the mass is displaced
The potential energy (PE) of the spring when it's displaced by 0.030 m can be calculated using Hooke's law:
PE = (1/2) * k * x^2
where k is the spring constant, and x is the displacement.

Step 2: Find the kinetic energy when the mass passes through its equilibrium position
The kinetic energy (KE) of the mass when it passes through its equilibrium position is given by:
KE = (1/2) * m * v^2
where m is the mass (0.30 kg) and v is its speed (0.040 m/s).

Step 3: Calculate the total mechanical energy
The total mechanical energy (E) of the system is the sum of its potential energy and its kinetic energy:
E = PE + KE

Step 4: Use the conservation of mechanical energy to find k
The mechanical energy is conserved, so the potential energy at the displacement should be equal to the kinetic energy at the equilibrium position:
(1/2) * k * x^2 = (1/2) * m * v^2

Solve for k:
k * x^2 = m * v^2
k = (m * v^2 ) / x^2

Plug in the values:
k = (0.30 kg * (0.040 m/s)^2) / (0.030 m)^2

k ≈ 17.78 N/m

Step 5: Calculate the potential energy
Now the spring constant is found, calculate the potential energy at displacement:
PE = (1/2) * k * x^2
PE = (1/2) * 17.78 N/m * (0.030 m)^2
PE ≈ 0.008 J

Step 6: Calculate the kinetic energy
Calculate the kinetic energy at the equilibrium position:
KE = (1/2) * m * v^2
KE = (1/2) * 0.30 kg * (0.040 m/s)^2
KE ≈ 0.00024 J

Step 7: Calculate the total mechanical energy
E = PE + KE
E = 0.008 J + 0.00024 J
E ≈ 0.00824 J

Now, convert the total mechanical energy to millijoules (mJ):
E ≈ 8.24 mJ"	False

A meter stick with a speed of 0.8c moves past an observer. In the observer’s reference frame, how long does it take the stick to pass the observer ?

A. 1.6 ns
B. 2.5 ns
C. 4.2 ns
D. 6.9 ns
"	True	True	True	B. 2.5 ns	"First, we know that the relativistic length contraction formula is given by:

L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)

where L is the contracted length, L0 is the original length (1 meter in this case), v is the velocity (0.8c), and c is the speed of light. Plugging in the values, we get:

L = 1 * sqrt(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2)
L = 1 * sqrt(1 - 0.64) = 1 * sqrt(0.36)
L = 1 * 0.6 = 0.6 meters

Now, we need to find how long it takes for the 0.6-meter-long stick to pass the observer. Since the speed of the stick is 0.8c, the time it takes can be found using the formula for distance:

distance = speed * time

Rearranging to solve for time:

time = distance/speed

Plugging in the values, we get:

time = 0.6 meters / 0.8c

To make calculations easier, we can express the speed of light as approximately 3 x 10^8 meters per second. So,

time = 0.6 meters / (0.8 * 3 x 10^8 meters/second)
time = 0.6 meters / (2.4 x 10^8 meters/second)

Now let's divide:

time = (0.6 / 2.4) x 10^-8 seconds
time = 0.25 x 10^-8 seconds

To express the time in nanoseconds, we can multiply by 10^9:

time = 0.25 x 10^-8 x 10^9 ns
time = 0.25 x 10^1 ns
time = 2.5 ns

So the correct answer is B. 2.5 ns."	"First, we need to find the length of the meter stick in the observer's reference frame using Lorentz contraction. The formula for Lorentz contraction is:

L' = L / γ

where L' is the contracted length, L is the original length, and γ is the Lorentz factor. The Lorentz factor is given by:

γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)

where v is the relative speed and c is the speed of light.

In this case, L = 1 m and v = 0.8c, so we first find γ:

γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.8c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.64) = 1 / √0.36 ≈ 1.67

Now we can find the length in the observer's reference frame:

L' ≈ 1 m / 1.67 ≈ 0.6 m

Now we need to find the time it takes for the meter stick to pass the observer. Since speed is distance divided by time (v = d/t), we can rearrange this formula to solve for time: 

t = d/v

In this case, d = L' and v = 0.8c:

t ≈ 0.6 m / (0.8c) ≈ 0.6 m / (0.8 * 3*10^8 m/s) ≈ 0.6 m / 2.4*10^8 m/s ≈ 2.5*10^-9 s

As we have found the time in nanoseconds (ns), we can write:

t ≈ 2.5 ns

Therefore, the most correct answer is (B) 2.5 ns."	False

The relativistic kinetic energy formula is: K = (γ - 1)mc^2, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

2. To find the Lorentz factor (γ), we use the formula γ = 1/√(1 - v^2/c^2), where v is the particle's velocity.

Plugging in the velocity (0.6c):

γ = 1/√(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2) = 1/√(1 - 0.36) = 1/√0.64 = 1/0.8 = 1.25
